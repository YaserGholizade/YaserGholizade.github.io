  I am a male Iran citizen, born in Ramsar and living in Tehran. I have already achieved in my country a high degree of academic technical competency. The first step of my higher academic training has been a Master in Mathematics from Tabriz University. During this time my studies have been focused on multiresolution analysis and its application in solving partial differential equations. After my master, I pursued a Ph.D. degree from Tabriz. My research has been about image processing and its applications. In particular, during my thesis work, I applied the methods from multiresolution analysis to the problem of edge detection in digital images using several kinds of wavelets (B-spline wavelets, Box-spline wavelets).

  During my Ph.D. studies, I have also been actively involved in two research projects related to MRI images funded by the Image Processing Laboratory of the Tabriz Medical University. In both projects, the algorithms have been implemented in MATLAB, the language where I have a professional proficiency.

  During my Iranian Ph.D. studies, I have been awarded a scholarship to spend a term abroad and I have spent it at Catania University, Italy, under the supervision of Prof. Giovanni Gallo. During this time I have been involved in a Medical Imaging project about female breast shape parametrization, to support reconstructive surgery.

   Back in Iran, after completing my Ph.D., I have been a fellow of Iran's National Elites Foundation. For this Institution, I worked on a project relative to my city about applying Computer Vision techniques to plan and distribute services in an urban context. Within this last project, I had the chance to acquire good knowledge about neural networks, deep learning algorithms, and their applications in image processing to be applied mostly to automatic object recognition. With this experience, I acquire a good know-how about deep learning and visual data analysis and after that, I have been focusing my studies and researches on this field.

    Finally, I worked in an IT Development Center in Iran (MAGFA Company) as a machine learning engineer. After one year, since I am very interested to increase my knowledge, I applied for second phd program in computer science in Italy and now I am a PhD student in computer science and working on explainable.
